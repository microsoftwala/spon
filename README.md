## Problem Statement
We're addressing the challenges faced by Indian farmers by providing a platform where they can sell their crops directly, eliminating middlemen and maximizing their profits. Farmers who have surplus equipment can easily rent it out, generating additional income with ease. Our platform also offers features like mapping nearby soil centers, enabling farmers to access vital resources. Farmers can create to-do lists, receiving timely reminders to manage their tasks efficiently. Moreover, farmers can provide soil information, receiving tailored crop recommendations to optimize their yield potential.

## About the Project
Our endeavor is to alleviate the challenges faced by Indian farmers through technological solutions, streamlining farming practices and enhancing their quality of life by providing innovative tools and resources.


## Technical Implementation
We're leveraging technology to address the challenges faced by modern-generation farmers through our innovative platform. Here are the key features we offer:

Equipment Rental: Farmers can easily rent out their surplus equipment, allowing them to monetize assets and support others in need.

**Direct Crop Sales**: By enabling direct crop sales without intermediaries, farmers can maximize profits and establish direct connections with buyers.

**Soil Center Mapping**: Our map feature helps farmers locate nearby soil centers, providing essential information on soil conditions and recommending suitable organic fertilizers for optimal crop growth.

**Todo Lists and Reminders**: Farmers can efficiently manage their day-to-day tasks with our todo lists and reminder feature, ensuring timely completion of important activities.

**Video Tutorials**: Access to a vast library of video tutorials offers farmers valuable insights and guidance on various farming techniques, empowering them to enhance their skills and knowledge.

**Machine Learning Crop Prediction**: Our advanced machine learning model analyzes soil data to predict the most suitable crops for specific soil types, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and improve crop yield.


## Techstacks used
Flask, ML, CSS, HTML, Jinja-2.

## How to run locally
First we need Flask

**pip install flask**

Run command

**flask --app filename.py --debug run**  // here You no need to reload the page 

**flask --app filename.py run** //here you have to run code again and again

## What Next
We are committed to enhancing our ML model to offer more accurate and robust predictions, and we are also planning to integrate an AI-powered chatbot. This chatbot will communicate with users in their native language, addressing their farming-related queries and providing valuable assistance to further simplify their farming experience.
